War-Card-Game
=============

The game will evenly deal a deck of cards to two players. The players will then each play one card at a time, and whichever player plays the higher value card wins that round. The player with the most cards at the end of 26 rounds (one full deck) wins the game. If players have equal winnings, the game is a tie.
